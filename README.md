# Terraform
This project contains my hands-on work with Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure. I'm using Terraform to provision and automate services like EC2, S3, IAM, and more. The goal is to better understand Infrastructure as Code by building practical setups and learning through real deployments.

It includes configuration files, modules, and notes that reflect my learning journey and can help others who are starting with Terraform and AWS.
